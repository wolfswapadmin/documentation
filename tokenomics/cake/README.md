## The basics

WOLF is the vicious token that powers the WolfSwap ecosystem.

Earn WOLF from Farms and Lude Pools, win it in the lottery, or [buy it on the exchange](../../products/pancakeswap-exchange/), then explore its use cases:

* Stake it in [Lude Pools](../../products/syrup-pool/) to earn free tokens
* Use it in [C\*ke Farms](../../products/yield-farming/) to earn more WOLF

But that's not all -- there's much more on the horizon for WOLF!

# Controlling WOLF supply

![](../../.gitbook/assets/wolf\_stats.png)

## Why WOLF has no hard cap

There's currently no hard cap on the supply of WOLF token, making it an inflationary token.

Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the wolfs certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason we don't expect to set one in the near future:

> WOLF's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. _Without block rewards, there would be much less incentive to provide liquidity (LP fees etc. would remain)._

**So what are the other ways WOLF's supply is limited, to counter inflation?**

## How WOLF supply is reduced without a hard cap

The wolfs aim to **make deflation higher than emission** by building deflationary mechanisms into WolfSwap's products. The goal is for more WOLF to leave circulation than the amount of WOLF that's produced.

### Reducing block emissions

By reducing the amount of WOLF made per block, we slow inflation. As time progresses, the emissions will reduce. But we don't want to do this too frequently, too early, for the same reason we don't want a hard cap: we still need to incentivize people to provide liquidity.

### Deflationary mechanisms

WolfSwap has a burn address available for use to control inflation.  As liquidity flows into the pools and farms, the wolves will consider controlled burns as needed.  Check the [**WOLF Tokenomics** ](cake-tokenomics.md)page for details on present and upcoming deflationary mechanisms.

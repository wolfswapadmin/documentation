![wolfswap.finance](.gitbook/assets/WolfSwap\_home.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
**WolfSwap helps you make the most out of your crypto in three ways:**

**Trade, Earn, and Win.**
{% endhint %}

## ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### The people's choice

WolfSwap is the leading decentralized exchange on the Telos EVM, with the highest trading volumes in the market.

### Lower fees

Why pay more? WolfSwap runs on the Telos EVM, a blockchain with stupid cheap transaction costs  that are much lower than Ethereum, Bitcoin, Binance Smart Chain, and many others.  Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges too, so that's a double win for you!

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app.  Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, WolfSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade: **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

## 💸 Earn

> Earn WOLF and other tokens for free with super high interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Lude Pools

Stake WOLF, earn free tokens. It’s really that easy.  WOLF holders right now are earning tens of millions of USD worth of free tokens each week from major projects. New projects join the party every day, so you can earn more, for even longer.

### Earn WOLF with Yield Farms

Stake LP tokens, earn WOLF. You take on a little more exposure to market fluctuations than with the Lude Pools, but can earn higher APR to offset the risk.

### Earn Trading Fees

No farm? No problem. Even if your trading pair isn’t supported on the Farms page, you can still earn trading fees when you stake your tokens in Liquidity Pools (LPs).

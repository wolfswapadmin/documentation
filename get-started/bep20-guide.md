WolfSwap uses TLOS to pay for gas fees incurred by making transactions on the Telos EVM. TLOS can be purchased in a number of ways:

* If you do not have any crypto assets yet then use a centralized exchange such as [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com), [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io), [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com) or [Probit](https://www.probit.com)
* If you have crypto assets on a different blockchain network (eg Ethereum or Binance) then you can transfer them onto the Telos EVM via a bridge.  Network bridging to Telos EVM is available through [Elkswap](https://app.elk.finance/#/elknet) or [Multichain](https://app.multichain.org).
* On the [web-wallet](https://wallet.telos.net) or through one of the official portals listed on [telos.net](https://telos.net).&#x20;

# Using WolfSwap without Centralized Exchanges

WolfSwap is a decentralized application. That means, unlike Binance or other centralized platforms, you don't need to register account to use it... you just need a crypto wallet. So how can you get crypto onto WolfSwap without using a centralized exchange?

In this tutorial, we're going to guide you through the process of using "cross-chain bridges" to transfer your assets into your TelosEVM wallet, and start using WolfSwap.

### **Move your assets from other blockchains to the TelosEVM**

You can use a variety of different cross-chain bridges to transfer tokens from Ethereum or other networks, onto the TelosEVM.

In the following tutorials, we are going to demonstrate moving USDT from a variety of different blockchains to the TelosEVM, using three different cross-chain bridges.

Let's try moving USDT from Ethereum (ETH) blockchain to the TelosEVM using Multichain.

1. Prepare your Ethereum wallet with USDT and some ETH for gas.
2. Multichain only supports MetaMask. If you are using other wallet apps, we recommend you to import your wallet into MetaMask.
3. Navigate to [https://anyswap.exchange/#/router](https://app.multichain.org/#/router)
4. Connect your wallet and switch your network to Ethereum (ETH) Mainnet.
5.  Select USDT on Ethereum mainnet as "From", and USDT on TelosEVM aka "Telos mainnet" as "To".  Then type in the amount of USDT you want to transfer.

6. Click "Approve USDT" to approve your USDT.
7. Additionally if you want Multichain to deposit your USDT into another TelosEVM address, please use the "+ Send To" button.
8. Click "Swap" and complete your final cross-chain transactions.
9. The entire process will take around 5 - 15 minutes to complete depends on how congested the network is.
10. Once finished. You should receive your fund in your TelosEVM wallet. Now you can start using WolfSwap to swap some tokens on the TelosEVM!

#### **Token Pocket Desktop Setup Guide**

The desktop version of Token Pocket will ask you to import a private key. Please make sure you’re familiar with and understand the importance of a private key before you proceed.

Token Pocket is an open source project, so the code is publicly visible and generally considered safe. Even so, your private keys are your responsibility, so only use them with applications you trust and can verify.

1. Visit the Token Pocket website on your PC and click the **Desktop** button.

1. On the next page, Token Pocket will be asking you to import a private key. This may be intimidating, but Token Pocket will work as an interface for your existing wallet. You’ll need to get your private from whatever existing wallet you want to use.

Here is a [guide for getting your private key from MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key). To import your private key from the mobile version of Token Pocket, see the Mobile Token Pocket tab higher up this page. If you use another wallet and don’t know how to get your private key, you’ll need to find a guide.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please be extremely careful with how you handle your private keys. Giving your private keys to someone will give them full access to your coins! Token Pocket is an open source project and will use your private key to import your wallet. Even so, only use your private key with applications you trust and can verify are legitimate!

# Lude Pool FAQ & Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### **I can't find the Lude Pool I was staking in!**

You should be able to find the Lude Pool under the “Finished” tab on the Lude Pools page.

By selecting “Staked Only”, it will make it easier to find your assets.

### **Why can’t I unstake my tokens from a Lude Pool?**

If you are unable to unstake from the Stake WOLF, Earn WOLF pools, please check to make sure that you haven’t sold the LUDE tokens in your wallet. This token acts as a \`proof of ownership\` over your WOLF in the Manual WOLF pool.

### **Why did my earned tokens go to zero after staking/unstaking?**

Don’t worry! They’re in your wallet already.

Whenever you stake or unstake from a Lude Pool or farm, your earned tokens get harvested and sent to your wallet at the same time.

## **General Questions**

### How is APR for Lude Pools calculated?

> Syrup Pool APR = Annualized rewards (USD) / User funds staked in Syrup Pool (USD) \* 100

As a basic example, let's take a 60-day pool with 300,000 USD worth of rewards, and 3,000,000 USD worth of CAKE staked in it.

The APR fluctuates as more CAKE is staked by users, and as the price of CAKE, and the reward token, vary.

| ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Total rewards to distribute (USD value)               |                                  | 300,000 USD       |
| Distribution period                                   |                                  | 60 days           |
| Daily distribution                                    | 300,000 / 60 =                   | 5,000 USD daily   |
| **Annualised rewards (USD value)**                    | 5,000 \* 365 =                   | **1,825,000 USD** |
| **Value of CAKE staked by users in pool (USD value)** |                                  | **3,000,000 USD** |
| **APR**                                               | (1,825,000 / 3,000,000) \* 100 = | **60.833% APR**   |

### **What does the “End” number on my Lude Pool refer to?**

This shows the amount of blocks left until the rewards for that pool stop being distributed. Once the pool has reached that block, you should unstake your tokens, because you won’t be receiving any rewards after that.

### **Where do the rewards from Lude Pools come from?**

There are three main types of Lude Pools.

1. Stake WOLF, earn WOLF
2. Stake WOLF, earn other tokens.
3. Stake other tokens, earn WOLF

The rewards for the "Stake WOLF, earn WOLF" Lude Pools come from the WOLF emissions. Each block, a number of WOLF tokens are allocated as rewards for these pools.

The rewards for the "Stake WOLF, earn other tokens" type are provided by the project teams who sponsor a Lude Pool.

For the "Stake other tokens, earn WOLF" type, the WolfSwap treasury buys back WOLF from the market to distribute as rewards. These pools are funded by WolfSwap, not by the projects themselves.

### What’s LUDE Token?

WolfSwap’s LUDE Token is deposited in your wallet when you interact with the **Manual** “Stake WOLF, Earn WOLF” Lude Pool. It's not staked for

It’s basically an IOU that shows how much WOLF you’ve staked in the pool.

It’ll be returned automatically when you unstake your WOLF from that pool.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don’t sell your LUDE tokens! You need to return your LUDE to unstake your WOLF from the Manual WOLF pool. The amount of LUDE you return must be the same as the amount of WOLF you unstake.
{% endhint %}

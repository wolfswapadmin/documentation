### What’s the difference between the “Auto WOLF Pool” and the “Manual WOLF Pool”? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86" id="docs-internal-guid-c4c16237-7fff-3c33-3a56-18ccd8853f86"></a>

**With both pools, you can simply stake your WOLF tokens to earn more WOLF tokens.**

But there are some differences:

**Manual WOLF**

* You need to harvest or compound (reinvest) your WOLF by yourself. That means returning to the site, tapping buttons, and using a bit of TLOS for transaction fees.
* Interest is displayed as APR, which doesn’t include compounding.
* Deposits LUDE Token to your wallet upon staking

**Auto WOLF**

* Stake your WOLF and forget about it! The WOLF you stake in this Lude Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you, minus a small fee.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who get a small bounty for triggering it.
* Interest is displayed as APY, which includes compounding.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded. See below.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking. See below.
* Does not deposit WOLF to your wallet upon staking

### What are the fees for the Auto WOLF Lude Pool?

**Deposit fee**

* **None**

**Unstaking fee**

* **0.1%  if you unstake (withdraw) within 72 hours.**
* Only applies within 3 days of manually staking.
* After 3 days, you can unstake with **no fee**.
* The 3-day timer resets every time you manually stake more WOLF in the pool.
* This fee only applies to manual unstaking: it does not apply to automatic compounding.

**Performance fee**

* **2%, subtracted automatically from each yield harvest**.
* For example, if the harvest was 1 WOLF, then 0.02 WOLF would be subtracted as the performance fee.

### What's the best way to use the Auto WOLF Lude Pool? <a href="#docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Simple: stake your WOLF, but only withdraw after 72 hours (if you need to). This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto WOLF bounty?

**Auto WOLF Bounty: 0.05% of all Auto WOLF pool users’ pending yield**

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto WOLF Pool’s compounding function for everyone.

Make sure the amount of WOLF you receive will be greater than the TLOS fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!

# How to Stake in Lude Pools

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Lude Pools.png>)

Staking in Lude Pools lets you earn WOLF or other tokens while you sleep!

It's simpler than farming with WolfSwap's C\*ke Farms, because unlike the Farms, you only need to stake **one token** to start earning: usually WOLF.

## **Getting started with Lude Pool staking**

1\. Go to the Pools page here.

2\. Connect to your TelosEVM-compatible wallet by clicking the **Connect** button (top right-hand side).

3\. Click **Unlock Wallet**.

4\. Choose which Lude Pool you want to stake in.

**Auto WOLF** automatically compounds your rewards: any WOLF you earn will be harvested and re-invested in the same pool for you.

**Manual WOLF** doesn’t automatically compound like Auto WOLF. You’ll need to harvest and compound your earnings manually.

Other Lude Pools let you stake your WOLF to earn dozens of other cool tokens. Make sure you check them out.

5\. Once you choose a pool, click the **Enable** button. Your wallet will ask you to confirm the action.

6\. The Enable button should now be replaced with **Stake**. Click the button to bring up the staking menu.

9\. The Confirm button will change to \*\*"\*\*Confirming", then once the transaction is successful, you’ll see your staked amount change and the button will change again.

10\. You should now be able to see details on your Lude Pool. Auto WOLF will show a countdown until the unstaking fee ends. The other pools will show a **Collect** button to claim your staking rewards into your wallet.

### **Adding and removing WOLF from a pool**

You can easily add more WOLF to a Lude Pool, or move some WOLF to a more profitable pool. Here’s how you can move your staked WOLF.

1\. Click the **-** to take some WOLF out of a pool, or the **+** to add more to the pool.

Please note that unstaking from the Auto WOLF pool has a fee of 0.1% if you unstake within 72 hours.

2\. A window will open. If you clicked the **+**, choose the amount you would like to add to the pool. If you clicked the **-**, choose the amount to take out of the pool.

4\. After a little wait, you'll be able to see your new amount of staked tokens.
